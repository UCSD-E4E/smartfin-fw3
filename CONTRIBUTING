# Commits
## Commit Messages
All commit messages MUST comply with [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

# Style Guide

## Whitespace
1. There must be one space character on each side of any binary operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
2. There must be one space character between a branching keyword and the conditional, e.g.:
```
while (cond)
{
    body
}
if (cond)
{
    body
}
for (cond)
{
    body
}
```
3. All files must end with an empty line.
4. All files must be indented with 4 spaces.
## Static Functions
1. Static function prototypes must live in their respective translation units.

## Include Order
Note: Inclusion of `<dirent.h>` may need to be preceded by `"Particle.h"` to provide system definitions.

Includes should be organized in the following order:
1. Application headers (with respect to the source root) in double quotes
2. Library headers in angle brackets
3. System headers in angle brackets
4. Platform headers

Where C system headers are used, prefer the C style header over the C++ style header (e.g. string.h over cstring)
